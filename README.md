# nix-configuration
The nix configuration of mine. I am trying to find a very suitable workplace for myself. If i can get to be as comfortable as i am in Arch Linux I will switch to the NixOS on my Desktop too.


But There are couple of things i need to do before:

- [x] add git hash to the nixos build generations
- [ ] fix cuda drivers
    - [ ] fix nvidia-smi command
    - [ ] compile a cuda program successfully
    - [ ] build a python package with embedded cuda and run successfully
- [ ] learn how to deal with development environments
- [ ] learn how to write derivations for cpp projects
- [ ] configure hyprland
- [ ] disk encryption with disko
- [ ] ssh gpg secret backup with sops
- [x] add unstable channels to the flake.nix
- [ ] home manager setup without translating every line in my configs to nix options. (tldr just symlink files the nix way)
- [x] add japanese IME fcitx5 mosc
- [ ] add beautifier to the nix code.
- [ ] make an ISO file with my configurations
- [ ] make a github action that tests if my configuration is gonna build successfully or not
- [x] learn cache management
- [x] add stylix
